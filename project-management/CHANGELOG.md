Summary of the session:

1. Slice 01 (repo skeleton + socle import) completed: `socle/` now holds the
   canonical methodology content, copied (not moved) from music-downloader's
   `doc/agents/` at current HEAD.

Project management:

- Completed **Slice 01 — repo-skeleton-import** of Task
  20260806-0959-chisel-v1: populated `socle/agents/{skills,rules}/`,
  `socle/templates/`, `socle/scripts/`; added `upstream.lock.json` at the
  repo root.

Key architectural and technical decisions:

- All 15 Pocock-forked skills copied into `socle/agents/skills/`, each
  gaining `x-upstream: {repo, path, sha, changes}` frontmatter (SHA
  `2ab958093e83e0ec752e6c1c5932da465bf23e0c`, current HEAD of the local
  `pocock-skills` clone); `upstream.lock.json` mirrors the same 15
  names/SHAs.
- The 3 Cursor task rules (`task-creation`, `task-progressing`,
  `task-completion`) ported to tool-agnostic `socle/agents/rules/*.md`: the
  `alwaysApply` Cursor frontmatter stripped, `.mdc` → `.md`, content
  otherwise byte-identical (hardcoded paths stay for slice 02).
- music-downloader was only ever read from (copy, never move) — verified via
  unchanged `git status` before/after.

## 1. 2026-08-06

Summary of the session:

1. Chisel is born: decisions D1–D7 grilled and locked (name, channel, layout,
   upstream sync, questionnaire, bundle content, versioning) — full log in the
   parent task's Notes.

Project management:

- Created **Task 20260806-0959-chisel-v1**: installable dev-workflow socle —
  parent task (product + architecture) + 7 slices (skeleton/import,
  genericize, installer CLI, setup questionnaire, upstream sync, pilot
  migration, release). Slices 01 → then 02/03/05 can run in parallel.

Key architectural and technical decisions:

- Unified `.agents/` layout (Codex + Cursor ≥2.4 native; Claude via one
  symlink); `AGENTS.md` source of truth, `CLAUDE.md` = `@AGENTS.md` import
- Editable-copy installer (sh behind npm bin), managed blocks, glue
  (`project.md`) as runtime indirection — rules stay byte-identical across
  projects
- Vendored Pocock forks with per-skill `x-upstream` frontmatter +
  `upstream.lock.json`; sync = agent proposes / human validates, ~2–6×/year
