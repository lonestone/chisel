## 4. 2026-08-06

Summary of the session:

1. Slice 05 (upstream sync) completed: a mechanical `sync-upstream.sh` script
   plus a `sync-upstream` skill give this repo a controlled path back to
   `mattpocock/skills` — drift detection and per-skill diffs are scripted;
   reading diffs and proposing merges is the agent's job; approving them is
   always the human's.

Project management:

- Completed **Slice 05 — upstream-sync** of Task 20260806-0959-chisel-v1:
  added `socle/scripts/sync-upstream.sh` (`--check` reports drifted skills
  with commit counts and frontmatter/lock SHA mismatches, zero writes beyond
  the upstream cache; `--diff <skill>` prints the raw upstream diff for one
  skill) and `socle/agents/skills/sync-upstream/SKILL.md` (the
  agent-proposes/human-validates loop, one skill at a time, with a
  heavy-divergence clause that proposes `x-upstream: none` instead of forcing
  a merge).

Key architectural and technical decisions:

- The script never applies anything, in either mode — its only side effect,
  ever, is cloning/fetching the upstream cache under
  `~/.cache/chisel/<owner>-<repo>/`. Reading a diff, proposing a merge that
  preserves a fork's documented `changes:`, and deciding to unplug a skill
  (`x-upstream: none`) all live in the skill's protocol, validated by the
  human skill by skill; an unanswered proposal counts as rejected.
- Real `--check` run against the live `upstream.lock.json` found 9 of the 15
  forked skills already drifted from the SHA recorded at slice 01 — none
  synced yet by design; this slice ships the tool, not the sync itself.

## 3. 2026-08-06

Summary of the session:

1. Slice 02 (genericize the socle) completed: no hardcoded music-downloader
   path remains in the socle — rules and skills resolve the task workspace,
   changelog, template, tracker, reading list, and glossary/ADR locations
   through `.agents/project.md` (the glue), written this slice as
   `socle/agents/project.md.tpl` with its 7 questionnaire sections (A–G).

Project management:

- Completed **Slice 02 — genericize-socle** of Task 20260806-0959-chisel-v1:
  rewrote the 3 task rules, `workflows.md`, `methodology.md`, and the task
  file template to resolve external paths via `.agents/project.md` instead of
  hardcoding `doc/project-management/...`; socle-internal skill links became
  relative (`../skills/...`); added the one-line glossary/ADR indirection to
  the 5 CONTEXT.md-heavy skills; swapped the 4 issue-tracker.md references to
  point at `.agents/project.md`'s Tracker section.

Key architectural and technical decisions:

- `socle/agents/issue-tracker.md` deleted — its content (mode, task paths,
  format, the "switch to an external tracker" procedure) is now absorbed into
  `project.md.tpl`'s Section B, the single place the tracker is configured.
- `CONTEXT.md` stays the artifact's *name* everywhere it's mentioned in skill
  bodies (untouched, per design); only its *location* now resolves through
  `.agents/project.md` where a path was previously hardcoded.
- Every edited Pocock-forked skill (9 of them) got its frontmatter `changes:`
  line extended with "; project paths resolve via .agents/project.md";
  `sha:` values and `upstream.lock.json` untouched — same upstream version,
  documented divergence.

## 2. 2026-08-06

Summary of the session:

1. Slice 01 (repo skeleton + socle import) completed: `socle/` now holds the
   canonical methodology content, copied (not moved) from music-downloader's
   `doc/agents/` at current HEAD.

Project management:

- Completed **Slice 01 — repo-skeleton-import** of Task
  20260806-0959-chisel-v1: populated `socle/agents/{skills,rules}/`,
  `socle/templates/`, `socle/scripts/`; added `upstream.lock.json` at the
  repo root.

Key architectural and technical decisions:

- All 15 Pocock-forked skills copied into `socle/agents/skills/`, each
  gaining `x-upstream: {repo, path, sha, changes}` frontmatter (SHA
  `2ab958093e83e0ec752e6c1c5932da465bf23e0c`, current HEAD of the local
  `pocock-skills` clone); `upstream.lock.json` mirrors the same 15
  names/SHAs.
- The 3 Cursor task rules (`task-creation`, `task-progressing`,
  `task-completion`) ported to tool-agnostic `socle/agents/rules/*.md`: the
  `alwaysApply` Cursor frontmatter stripped, `.mdc` → `.md`, content
  otherwise byte-identical (hardcoded paths stay for slice 02).
- music-downloader was only ever read from (copy, never move) — verified via
  unchanged `git status` before/after.

## 1. 2026-08-06

Summary of the session:

1. Chisel is born: decisions D1–D7 grilled and locked (name, channel, layout,
   upstream sync, questionnaire, bundle content, versioning) — full log in the
   parent task's Notes.

Project management:

- Created **Task 20260806-0959-chisel-v1**: installable dev-workflow socle —
  parent task (product + architecture) + 7 slices (skeleton/import,
  genericize, installer CLI, setup questionnaire, upstream sync, pilot
  migration, release). Slices 01 → then 02/03/05 can run in parallel.

Key architectural and technical decisions:

- Unified `.agents/` layout (Codex + Cursor ≥2.4 native; Claude via one
  symlink); `AGENTS.md` source of truth, `CLAUDE.md` = `@AGENTS.md` import
- Editable-copy installer (sh behind npm bin), managed blocks, glue
  (`project.md`) as runtime indirection — rules stay byte-identical across
  projects
- Vendored Pocock forks with per-skill `x-upstream` frontmatter +
  `upstream.lock.json`; sync = agent proposes / human validates, ~2–6×/year
